##### About the project
- I used Excel for data cleaning data to help strengthen my command of the fundamental spreadsheet tool.
- This dashboard displays the yearly cumulative number of accidents that occurred in the UK region. The dashboard can be filtered by year and accident severity, and it can make value comparisons between the previous and current years. It also displays the number of casualties by vehicle or road category. Weather conditions and road surfaces are also used to locate fatalities of varying severity. 
- The orginal dataset consisted of 27 fields out of which only 14 of them are utilized for this use case
- The visual representation of the Fatal severity for the year 2022 is displayed below. The comparison could be drawn for any year between 2019 to 2022.
